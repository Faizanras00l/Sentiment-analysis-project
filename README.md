## ‚ú® Overview

This project leverages machine learning and NLP to classify review sentiments as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**. It includes everything from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization, with ready-to-use pretrained weights for instant predictions.

## üöÄ Features

- Automated data cleaning and preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Detailed metrics and visualizations
- Pretrained model weights for fast deployment
- Custom review sentiment prediction

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-project.git
cd sentiment-analysis-project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python packages in one magical command:

```sh
pip install nltk scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn wordcloud joblib
```

### 3. Download NLTK Data

Ensure all necessary NLTK corpora are available:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')
```

### 4. Prepare the Dataset

Download the [Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews) dataset from Kaggle and place `Reviews.csv` in the project root directory.

### 5. Using Pretrained Models

Pretrained weights are stored in the `WeightsMatrix/` folder for instant predictions:

```python
import joblib

model = joblib.load('WeightsMatrix/sentiment_model.pkl')
vectorizer = joblib.load('WeightsMatrix/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl')
```

### 6. Run the Notebook

Open `Sentiment_analysis_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and execute the cells sequentially to experience the full workflow.

## üßô Custom Sentiment Prediction

Predict the sentiment of any review in seconds:

```python
def preprocess(text):
    # ...same as in notebook...
    return cleaned_text

review = "Absolutely loved the taste and quality!"
cleaned = preprocess(review)
vectorized = vectorizer.transform([cleaned])
prediction = model.predict(vectorized)[0]
print(f"Sentiment: {prediction}")
```

## üìä Results & Visualization

All evaluation metrics and insightful visualizations are automatically saved in the `Parameters/` folder for your analysis and reporting needs.
